## Monthly (web/)
- Outdated check: `npm outdated` showed @types/node 24.10.8 (updated) and latest 25.x deferred by policy.
- Updates: `npm update` (40 packages updated).
- Audit: `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` reports high vulnerabilities in transitive deps (axios, valibot) via @reown/appkit-adapter-bitcoin with no upstream fix; elliptic fix requires breaking @stacks/connect downgrade.

## Quarterly
